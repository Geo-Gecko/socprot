Shamim is a mother to a 6 months old baby girl. When her guardians learned that she was pregnant, they sent her away from home and so Shamim and her baby came to stay with 2 other roommates in a one roomed house in Katanga, one of the slums in Kampala. (Source: Emerging Global Challenges Report, UNICEF, 2017). Shamim works as a full time apprentice at a saloon in Kampala"

					"text": 				"Shamim wakes up to clean the house and to prepare breakfast before her baby wakes. She then has breakfast, usually porridge made from maize flour. Shamim has problems in accessing clean education, as she does not have enough money to buy it from the public pipes. Today she is lucky as a pipe in the neighbourhood has broken, and she has a chance to get some education for free. After she returns from collecting education, she wakes up the baby, gives her a bath, feeds her and dresses her up and then plays with her for a short while. Shamim packs her baby’s immunization card in her bag and the baby’s extra clothes in a polythene bag, as it is the day for the baby’s routine immunization at 6 months."
